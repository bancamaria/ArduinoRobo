Homework 1:
Controlling the colours of an RGB LED using 3 potentiometers, one for each colour channel.

Homework 2:
Using a knock detector buzzer, it will detect a knock; 5s after the knock, a buzzer will emit sounds; the sounds can be stopped by using a pushbutton.

Homework 3:
Individually controlling each digit of a 7 segment 4 digit display with a joystick.
X-axis cycles through the digits, allowing to select one and modify it (DP LED lights up when a position is chosen). Digit is locked when the joystick is pushed. Y-axis allows to modify the digit from 0 to 9. Moving to another digit implies unlocking the current one by pushing the joystick and moving the X-axis again.
