Description:
The classic Breakout Game, but this time on an Arduino board!
The player has to break all the bricks with a ball which jumps on a platform. And since we are in December, you can have a Christmassy song played while you are playing. But don't worry! If the songs are disturbing you, you can stop it by pressing the pushbutton!
- there is a score;
- you can introduce your name to keep record of who had the highscore (highscore is saved in EEPROM);
- there are levels;
- each level increases the speed of the ball;
